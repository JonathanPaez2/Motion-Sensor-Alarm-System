# Motion-Sensor-Alarm-System
""" In a team of two, using the Twilio Communication API and a GPIO, we created a program which allowed our alarm system that when an intruder stepped in range of our 
motion sensor... the Python code would sent an email to us of the time and date at which the intrusion took place while also making a loud noise through a buzzer.
